Libft is the very first project available at 42 schools.

  The assignement is pretty straight forward: re-implement some of the LIBC functions. 
The point of doing such exercise, is to build basic knowledge on the inner working of C strings.
Re-implementing a library might seem tedious and potentially useless: "Why should I create tools that already exist?". 
Although I would argue it is crucial for any developper to aquire an advanced understanding of C. 
The way it forces the developper into implementing its own solutions from scratch, allows for great problem solving ability improvement. That added to the low level features of C, makes up room for performance, freedom, and optimization.
This unforgiving language does not leave error nor messy habits unpunished, which brings the developper towards cleaner, self-explanatory code.
I am not one to judge uppon the difficulty scale of different languages, as each purposes has its suiting tool. 
That being said, it is important not to forget the crucial role C has within computer sciences history and developpment. 
If a developper understands and masters C, it will most likely understand higher level of abstraction fairly easily.
There's always a developper to tell you to go lower level if you don't wanna be a noob. That is not an absolute truth.

Learn C though.
