Libft is the very first project available at 42 schools.

The assignement is pretty straight forward: re-implement some of the LIBC functions. 
The point of doing such exercise, is to build solid knowledge on the inner working of C strings.
Re-implementing a library might seem tedious and potentially useless: "Why should I create tools that already exist?" 
is a valuable argument. Although I think it is crucial for any developper to aquire an advanced understanding of C and the way
it functions as it plays a crucial role in most of the moddern languages.
